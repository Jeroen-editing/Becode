    <h3>A funny story</h3>
    <hr>
      <div>
      <p>For one of my schoolprojects at the Academy (filmschool), the director I was working for, made a crapy movie about vampires.<br>
        The fun stuff for me was, that I had to use a lot of special effects and use cheats to edit the story. Like removing reflections from mirrors and making scenes darker, looking like nighttime.
        But the problem was that the main actor was verry bad. Over-acting all the time and not speaking clear. Luckely I discovered that somtimes the camerman kept his camera running after a take was recorded. Somtimes also during the comments of the director. And those recordings were much better to use for reactions and facial expressions from that bad actor. So for almost 50% of the time, I used off-record footage. And saved the graduation project from the director.<br>
        No need to say that the actor was verry suprised to see him 'not acting at all'.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>TL;DR</h4>
      <p><em>"Editing is like coding: solving problems all the time."</em></p>
